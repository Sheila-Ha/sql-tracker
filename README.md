-   ### DEMO:  
    - (https://app.screencast.com/Fqo3eB1qLax79)

## Features  
1. Delete Department
2. Delete Role
3. Delete Employee

## Challenges  
- Starting in async/await and switching to promises.  
- Proper syntax for db.query involving SELECT, VALUES, JOIN, INNER JOIN and etc.  
- Had to create E.role_id and M.role_id (employee/manager) because I needed to pull same employees for two different requests.  
- Not realizing how much longer this assignment was going to take.  
- I used mysql2 vs createConnection and it would puke consecutively after calling anything on the 11 time.  
  
- Ran out of time   
  - Testing
